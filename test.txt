process 
(maybe have a feature in front end show which rooms are avai for the dates they selected so maybe gray out specific room types )
user makes a booking online/ on premise (very rare)

if online (a default user id is given to the booking (called online booking or something))

they can edit the booking before the date/ during thier stay also (can also cancel booking)

booking auto assigns them a room based on the type of room they asked for (room management) based on availability 

self check in: 
user checks in through a kiosk or something
(keys in their booking id and their full name )

once checked in -> the booking status is updated to checked-in and room key is generated and sent to them via notification service



MAIN PROB: HOW TO MANAGE THE HOTEL ROOMS, PRVENT BOOKING IF U FORSEE THAT THIS ROOM IS UNAVAILABLE
